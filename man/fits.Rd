\title{Fits the best model from classes ARIMA, ETS, TBATS and NNETAR.}
\usage{
fits(x, train = 0.8, steps = NULL, max.points = 500,
  show.main.graph = T, show.sec.graph = F, show.value = T, PI = F,
  theme.doj = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector or ts object.}

\item{train}{The (initial) percentage of the time series to be used to train the models. Must be \code{0 < train < 1}.}

\item{steps}{Number of steps to forecast. If \code{NULL}, uses the number of points not used in training (testing points). Can't be less than the number of testing points.}

\item{max.points}{Limits the maximum number of points to be used in modeling. Uses the first \code{max.points} points of the series.}

\item{show.main.graph}{Logical. Should the main graphic (with the final model) be displayed?}

\item{show.sec.graph}{Logical. Should the secondary graphics (with the training models) be displayed?}

\item{show.value}{Logical. Should the values be displayed?}

\item{PI}{Prediction Interval used in nnar models. Must take long time processing.}
}
\value{
\code{$fcast} predicted time series using the model that minimizes the forecasting mean square error.
\code{$runtime} running time.
\code{mse.pred} mean squared error of prediction. Used to decide the best model.
}
\description{
